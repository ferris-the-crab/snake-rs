# SNAKE-RS

This is simply a project in my Rust journey. NOT intended for actual use!
I will not be publishing any pre-built binaries nor do I plan on maintaining it in the future.
The game is not finished. Things like fruits/berries and the actual snake itself doesn't exist.
But go and check it out if you want to :)

## Building
Requirements:
* Cargo/Rust
* A terminal with support for Crossterm
